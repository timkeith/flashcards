# A Flashcard app using [React.js](https://reactjs.org)

This app takes a list of questions and answers and presents them
randomly to the user. As the user becomes more confident of the
answer, the card appears less frequently.

#### `npm install`

Generate word list from `.csv` file

#### `perl gen-words.pl  < words.csv > src/data/words.js`

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
